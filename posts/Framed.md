Framed combines the Bose AR ecosystem with the spy genre to inspire action and enrich the real world with an engaging narrative. Players put on what appears to be a regular Bose device, only to discover they are now caught up in a thick plot between competing spy agencies. Player choices and reactions can change the outcome of the many encounters they will face.
